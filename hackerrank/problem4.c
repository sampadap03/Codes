/*You have an array initially with single element N. You have to perform certain modifications on the array. In each modification you must remove any element a, such that a > 1, from the list and insert at the same position floor(a/2) , a mod 2 , floor(a/2) sequentially.You must continue with these operations until all the elements in the array are either 0 or 1.

Note: See this link if you don't know about floor function. Floor Function

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains three space separated integers N , L , R .

Constraints

0 ≤ r - l ≤105
r ≥ 1 , l ≥ 1

Output Format

Output total number of 1's in the range l to r in the final sequence.(l and r included.)
Note: Indexing starts from 1.
