/*Krushna wants know how many good sequences of length l exists using first n integers.

A sequence of l integers b1 , b2 , b3 . . . . . bl is said to be good if each number divides (without a remainder) the next number in the sequence. More formally bi | bi+1 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ l -1.

Given n and k find the number of good sequences of length k . As the answer can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007(109 + 7).

Input Format

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n, k .

Constraints

1 ≤ n,k ≤ 2000

Output Format

Output the number of good sequences of length k modulo 1000000007(109 + 7).
